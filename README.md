Nodecoin README
Overview
Nodecoin is a next-generation cryptocurrency designed for the metaverse and Web3 ecosystems. It combines advanced blockchain technologies with a unique multi-tier node system, a hybrid consensus mechanism, and powerful AI-driven features to provide a scalable, secure, and privacy-focused network. Nodecoin's mission is to empower users with decentralized financial tools while offering seamless integration with virtual and augmented reality applications.

Features
Multi-Tier Node System:

Validator Nodes: Secure the network and validate transactions.

Light Nodes: Facilitate lightweight access for users and reduce resource consumption.

Relay Nodes: Ensure fast and reliable transmission of transactions across the network.

Archive Nodes: Store historical data for auditability and transparency.

Hybrid Consensus Mechanism (PoST):

Nodecoin uses a Proof of Staked Transactions (PoST) consensus mechanism, combining Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Activity (PoA) to ensure efficient validation while incentivizing active participation.

Smart Nodes:

Nodes dynamically adjust their roles based on the network's demand, optimizing resource allocation and maintaining network health.

AI-Powered Fraud Detection:

Machine learning algorithms detect and mitigate fraud, enhancing security across the network.

Privacy Layer:

A built-in privacy feature that allows users to make anonymous transactions, ensuring user confidentiality.

Cross-Blockchain Integration:

Initially launched on Solana, Nodecoin aims to develop a standalone blockchain in the future. It also integrates with the XRP Ledger for greater flexibility and reach.

Web3 UI:

A user-friendly Web3 interface that allows users to interact with Nodecoin's staking, transfers, and rewards across both Solana and XRP Ledger seamlessly.
